    <h3>From the Editor</h3>
    This recipe uses 2 layers of lasagna noodles by slightly overlapping 6 noodles on each layer. The video for this recipe features 3 layers, using 4 noodles on each layer that don't overlap. If you follow the video, use 1 cup of meat sauce and 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture in each layer.
